## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 15, React 18.3
- UI: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, lucide-react
- Editor: @monaco-editor/react
- State: zustand
- Backend: Convex
- Auth: Clerk

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended LTS)
- An account for:
	- Clerk (for auth keys)
	- Convex (for deployment URL)
	- Lemon Squeezy (only if you plan to enable paid webhooks)

## Quick Start

1) Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2) Create `.env.local` at the project root

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# From your Convex project or dev deployment
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Optional: set in provider dashboards and Convex env for verification
# CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
# LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

3) Start the app (development)

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

## Building for Production

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuring Services

### Clerk

- Create an application in Clerk.
- Copy Publishable and Secret keys into `.env.local`.
- Set allowed redirect/callback URLs if you enable OAuth.

### Convex

- Create a Convex project or start a dev deployment.
- Populate `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local`.
- For webhook verification (optional), add `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Convex dashboard env vars as well.

### Payments (Optional)

Lemon Squeezy webhook verification is supported. Add `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to your Convex environment and provider.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` â€” start the Next.js dev server
- `npm run build` â€” create a production build

## Environment Variables Reference

Required for local dev:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` â€” Clerk publishable key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` â€” Clerk secret key
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` â€” Convex deployment identifier
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` â€” Convex URL

Optional (if using webhooks):

- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` â€” verify Clerk webhooks in Convex
- `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` â€” verify Lemon Squeezy webhooks in Convex

## Troubleshooting

- Dev server exits immediately (Windows)
	- Kill stray Node processes and clear the Next cache:
		```powershell
		Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
		Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
		npm run dev
		```
- React/Monaco peer dependency
	- React is pinned to 18.3 for @monaco-editor/react compatibility.
- Convex not reachable
	- Ensure `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` are set and valid.
- Clerk errors
	- Double-check publishable/secret keys and domain settings in Clerk dashboard.

## Deploy

Deploy to your favorite platform (e.g., Vercel). Donâ€™t forget to add all env vars in the hosting dashboard. Build with `npm run build` and start with `npm start`.
